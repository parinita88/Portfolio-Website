						<h1>Overview</h1>
					</header>

					<p>
						This project aimed to analyze 75,000 transactions of a retail store from October 2019 to October 2020. Through data 
						analysis, patterns were discovered in the data, and a dashboard was developed using Tableau.
					</p>
					<hr class="major" />


					<h2>Dataset</h2>
					<p>
						RFWD project provided the retail dataset in csv format. It was a simple and clean dataset, with
						more than 75,000 rows. The dataset had the following information on a day-to-day basis, from
						October 2019 to October 2020:
					<ul>
						<li>transaction_date</li>
						<li>transaction_hour</li>
						<li>location_state</li>
						<li>location_city </li>
						<li>rewards_number </li>
						<li>rewards_member </li>
						<li>num_of_items </li>
						<li>coupon_flag </li>
						<li>discount_amt </li>
						<li>order_amt</li>

					</ul>
					</p>


					<h2>Data Analysis</h2>
					<p> Based on the data available, I asked the following questions to analyse it -
					<ul>
						<li>
							How many items were sold?
						</li>
						<li>
							How much money did the retail store make from selling products?
						</li>
						<li>
							How many transactions took place?
						</li>
						<li>
							How does the sales pattern change on each day of the month?
						</li>
						<li>
							Are the sales higher or lower compared to the previous month?
						</li>
						<li>
							How many transactions were done and items were purchased by customers who are part of the rewards program?
						</li>
						<li>
							How are the sales of items spread out across different states and cities in the country?
						</li>
						<li>
							Which cities have the highest and lowest sales performance?
						</li>
						<li>
							Does the number of transactions vary based on the specific day of the week and time of day?
						</li>
					</ul>
					</p>

					<p>
						Starting with the above-mentioned questions, I identified the following patterns in the data -
					<ul>
					<li>
						The rewards program plays a significant role in driving approximately 30% of monthly sales. However, due to the 
						limited customer information available in this dataset, it is challenging to confirm whether rewards members are more 
						likely to be repeat customers.
					</li>
					<li>
						The dataset only provides sales data for five states, revealing variations in sales among them. For instance, 
						Florida outperforms the other states in terms of sales. To better understand the reasons behind these variations, 
						additional data is required. Factors such as volume of customers, distribution of stores, and effectiveness of any
						promotions or discounts need to be considered.
					</li>
					<li>
						It is important to analyze the sales patterns across different times of the day and days of the week. Understanding 
						these patterns is crucial for effective inventory management, particularly during 
						peak times when frequent restocking may be necessary.
					</li>
					<li>
						There are noticeable variations in sales between different months, suggesting the presence of seasonality within the data. 
						Furthermore, there is also variation in sales within each month. These fluctuations can be attributed to factors like holiday 
						seasons, such as Christmas, when consumer spending tends to increase.

						Tracking and analyzing these variations is crucial, particularly for retail stores operating on low profit margins. Understanding 
						the patterns and trends in sales will enable better inventory management and strategic decision-making.
						
						Additionally, tracking these variations will help assess the effectiveness and impact of any ongoing sales promotions implemented 
						by the store. This information can inform future marketing strategies and help optimize sales performance.
					</li>
				</ul>
					</p>

					<h2>Dashboard Design</h2>
					<ul>
						I created wireframes of the dashboard. Then, I created the dashboard using Tableau
						<p>
							<li>
								First, I presented trends for essential Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) in the data, such as Sales, Number of Items Sold, 
								and Number of Transactions. To provide a clear overview, I utilized BAN (Big Accessible Numbers) in Tableau, showcasing summary 
								statistics for these KPIs. Additionally, I included contextual information by displaying the changes in KPIs compared to the 
								previous month.
								Furthermore, I created area charts to depict the KPIs at a daily level within each month. This visualization enables executives 
								to identify any variations in the KPI values throughout the month, helping them identify patterns, such as increased shopping 
								during holidays or specific events within the month.
							</li>
							<li> 
								Since the data includes geographical information such as state and city, I leveraged this data to create maps. By utilizing 
								map layers, I was able to identify the states and cities with the highest and lowest sales, transactions, and items sold. 
								This visualization approach provides valuable insights into geographic trends and performance, helping to pinpoint areas of 
								high and low activity within the dataset.
							
							</li>
							<li>
								Furthermore, considering the variations in data across different cities, I showcased the most popular and least popular cities. 
								To identify these cities, I employed set calculations in Tableau, allowing for a clear distinction between high and low performing 
								cities.
							</li>
							<li>In addition, I created a heatmap to analyze customer preferences in terms of specific days and times. This heatmap visualizes the 
								popularity of different time intervals throughout the day, helping to identify the periods when customers were more active or 
								engaged.
								These visualizations provide valuable insights into the customer behavior patterns, enabling businesses to make informed decisions based on 
								customer preferences and trends.
							</li>
							<li>
							To improve the user experience, I implemented interactive features such as filters to select specific months and years. 
							Users also have the flexibility to switch between different metrics, including sales, items, and transactions, for the 
							map and heatmap visualizations. 
							I strategically used color in the map to highlight states with high values for metrics such as sales, items sold, and transactions. 
							This visual emphasis draws attention to areas of significant performance. A similar strategy was applied to the heatmap, enabling 
							the identification of days and times with high metric values. This approach facilitates the key stakeholders to find areas of significant 
							performance in a quick glance.
							</li>
					</p>
				</ul>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>
						Overall, I found working on this project to be a highly enjoyable experience. Although I get
						stuck sometimes with finding patterns in the data, but asking relevant questions always helps. I
						have realised that as I create more projects, I am becoming proficient in identifying KPIs as
						well as creating visuals in Tableau. I completed this project in 3 days, working around 5 hours
						a day. 
						If I had more time, I would like to make the interactivity more polished with adding a
						menu, download options for the dashboard, etc.
