						<h1>Overview</h1>
					</header>

					<p>
						This project focused on analysing the transactions of a retail store for the time between
						October 2019 to October 2020. After data analysis, patterns were identified in the data 
						and dashboard was created using Tableau.
					</p>
					<hr class="major" />


					<h2>Dataset</h2>
					<p>
						RFWD project provided the retail dataset in csv format. It was a simple and clean dataset, with
						more than 75,000 rows. The dataset had the following information on a day-to-day basis, from
						October 2019 to October 2020:
					<ul>
						<li>transaction_date</li>
						<li>transaction_hour</li>
						<li>location_state</li>
						<li>location_city </li>
						<li>rewards_number </li>
						<li>rewards_member </li>
						<li>num_of_items </li>
						<li>coupon_flag </li>
						<li>discount_amt </li>
						<li>order_amt</li>

					</ul>
					</p>


					<h2>Data Analysis</h2>
					<p> Based on the data available, I asked the following questions to analyse it -
					<ul>
						<li>
							How many items were sold?
						</li>
						<li>
							What is the value of Sales in the Retail store?
						</li>
						<li>
							How many orders were placed?
						</li>
						<li>
							What is trend on each day of the month?
						</li>
						<li>
							How does the sales compare to the last month?
						</li>
						<li>
							How many orders and items were bought by rewards members?
						</li>
						<li>
							How is the sale of item distributed across the countrty?
						</li>
						<li>
							which are the top 5 performing cities? bottom 5 performing cities?
						</li>
						<li>
							how do orders vary by week of the day? time of the day?
						</li>
					</ul>
					</p>

					<p>
						Starting with these questions, helped me to see the following patterns in the data -
					<ul>
					<li>
						The rewards members bring in around 30% of sales every month. The rewards members may be more be more
						inclined to be repeat customers, but this cannot be verified in this dataset as we do not have more customer 
						information.
					</li>
					<li>
						We only have data for sales in five states. But there's variation in sales among these states. For instance,
						sales are better in Florida than the other states. More data will be required to assess why some states have
						more sales - do they have more customers? more stores? better discounts?
					</li>
					<li>
						Depending upon the month, some times of day and days of week have better sales than others 
						(pointing to seasonality in the data) - which is important to know as the store might need to 
						restock inventory frequently during these times.
					</li>
					<li>
						Sales in some months is more than others, and there's also variation between each day of the month, which 
						could be due to people shopping more during holidays like christmas.
						The variation needs to be tracked, as it can have significant impact specially if the retail store operates 
						on low margin. The profit data was unavailable in the dataset. 
						Also, the tracking will also help to track the impact of any sales promotions, which the store may be running.
					</li>
				</ul>
					</p>

					<h2>Dashboard Design</h2>
					<ul>
						I created wireframes of the dashboard. Then, I created the dashboard using Tableau
						<p>
							<li>First, I displayed trends for important Key Performance Indicators in the 
								data (Sales, No of Items sold, No of Orders). Here, I used BAN(Big Accessible Numbers) in Tableau to show 
								summary statistics for the KPIs, added context by showing change in the KPI as compared to the previous month.
								Also, I created area charts to show the KPIs within the month at a day level, this help the
								executives to identify if thereâ€™s any variation in the values of KPI within a month (to
								see if there are patterns in a month like people may shopping more during any holidays
								in the month) </li>
							<li> Since the data had geographical locations (State and City), I decided to create maps and
								used
								map layers to identify the states and cities with most and least sales, orders and
								items
								sold.</li>
							<li>Further, as the data varied between cities as well, I displayed the most popular and least
								popular
								cities, which I identified with help of set calculations in Tableau.</li>
							<li>I also created a heatmap to identify which days and time of the day were more popular
								with
								the
								customers.</li>
						<li>
						To enhance the user experience, I added interactivity like filters to select the month and year. I also allowed 
						users to switch the metric between sales, items and orders for the map and heatmap.
						I selectively used colour to highlight areas of key performance (sales/items sold/orders)
					</li>
					</p>
				</ul>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>
						Overall, I found working on this project to be a highly enjoyable experience. Although I get
						stuck sometimes with finding patterns in the data, but asking relevant questions always helps. I
						have realised that as I create more projects, I am becoming proficient in identifying KPIs as
						well as creating visuals in Tableau. I completed this project in 3 days, working around 5 hours
						a day. 
						If I had more time, I would like to make the interactivity more polished with adding a
						menu, download options for the dashboard, etc.
